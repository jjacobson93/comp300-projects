Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to implement an FSM in SystemVerilog that controls the turn signals on a 1965 Ford Thunderbird and test the implementation with a testbench in ModelSim. 

Testbench Design
================
My testbench tests a left turn, a right turn, and then a left turn "interrupted" by a right turn.

Resource Usage

13 registers
10 pins
